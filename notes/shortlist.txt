Bugs:
App crashes when creating a lobby through prompt_server.
  Randomly get 'invalid form body', when attempting to delete the original user message.
  Current solution: Original user message does not get deleted.



Missing features:
Join lobby by reacting to confirm_lobby, create, list messages.
Implement RichEmbeds(Because, prettier).
Confirm lobby by calling "!lob" or "!lob lobby"
